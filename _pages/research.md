Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is defined as a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) occurring exclusively in the brain, spinal cord, leptomeninges, or eye, according to the new World Health Organization (WHO) classification of central nervous system tumors. PCNSLs have distinct characteristics that set them apart from nodal DLBCLs. Due to their rarity, molecular characterization has been limited to a small number of samples, and the involvement of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in disease progression and/or treatment response has remained unknown. 

Our central hypothesis is that variations in tumor cell states and TME organization play a role in lymphomagenesis and progression. We believe that distinct TMEs contribute to the intra- and intertumoral heterogeneity of PCNSL and that these TMEs can be targeted in the future. 

This proposal includes three complementary and multidisciplinary objectives aimed at 

  1) Characterizing the immune landscape at the single-cell level
  2) Improving prognostic and predictive markers
  3) Proposing a mechanistic analysis by examining the different molecular subtypes of PCNSL.
