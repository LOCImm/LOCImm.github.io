# Research - LOCImm project

Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is defined as a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) occurring exclusively in the brain, spinal cord, leptomeninges, or eye, according to the new World Health Organization (WHO) classification of central nervous system tumors. 

PCNSLs have distinct characteristics that set them apart from nodal DLBCLs. Due to their rarity, molecular characterization has been limited to a small number of samples, and the involvement of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in disease progression and/or treatment response has remained unknown. 

Our central hypothesis is that variations in tumor cell states and TME organization play a role in lymphomagenesis and progression. We believe that distinct TMEs contribute to the intra- and intertumoral heterogeneity of PCNSL and that these TMEs can be targeted in the future. 

This proposal includes three complementary and multidisciplinary objectives aimed at 

  **1) Characterizing the immune landscape at the single-cell level**
  
  **2) Improving prognostic and predictive markers**
  
  **3) Proposing a mechanistic analysis by examining the different molecular subtypes of PCNSL.**

## Research structure

We are located within the [Paris Brain Institute](https://institutducerveau-icm.org/en/) in the [Brain tumor group](https://institutducerveau-icm.org/en/team/team-sanson-huillard/). The medical team belongs to the [Neurology Department at Pitié Salpêtrière Hospital](https://pitiesalpetriere.aphp.fr/neurologie-oncologie-myologie/).

Our patients belong to the **RENOCLIP-LOC Network** (Rare cancers of the central nervous system)

The **RENOCLIP-LOC network**, approved by the [National Cancer Institute (INCa)](https://en.e-cancer.fr), was born from the merger in 2019 of the two networks **POLA** and **LOC**.

### LOC Network National Expert for Oculocerebral Lymphomas

The LOC network was created in 2011, as part of the 2009-2013 Cancer Plan. It is a national medical expert network, recognized and funded by the National Cancer Institute (INCa). Its objective is to improve the management of and research into primary lymphomas of the central nervous system (primary cerebral and/or intra-ocular lymphomas), which represent a rare form of adult tumour. The network consists of a national expert centre in Ile de France, at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris and the René Huguenin Hospital/Institut Curie in Saint Cloud, and twenty regional expert centres throughout France.

### POLA National Expert Network dedicated to the management of High-Grade Oligodendroglial Tumours

The POLA Network aims to improve the management of and research on certain brain tumours (anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, anaplastic oligoastrocytomas, grade IV oligoastrocytomas with necrosis, and glioblastomas with an oligodendroglial component) that are rare tumours in adults. This Network is funded by both the [National Cancer Institute (INCa)](https://en.e-cancer.fr) and the [National League Against Cancer](https://www.ligue-cancer.net).
